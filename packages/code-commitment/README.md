# Code Commitment

This is an actively developed Spear product. It commits to resolving bugs within five business days. When ambiguous, product owners use their best judgment to decide what is and isn’t a bug. Each Monday — excluding holidays — is devoted to maintenance, such as squashing bugs and reducing technical debt. Teams can continue maintenance past Monday if they so choose.
